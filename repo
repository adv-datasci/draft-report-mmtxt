Option 1
A major disaster is currently underway with hurricane Harvey. 
Use social media data (Twitter, Instagram, Reddit etc.) to identify times and areas that are hardest hit from the hurricane
Plans to do it:
search the main word of "hurricane Harvey" and got it main location and the time it sent, also the place that mentioned in the tw,
count the times the place has been mentioned.

instagrame: get information from the comments
reddit: get place name at the post? how?

Questions:
1. how to get the information from the internet through R
2. can i just let R find and count the place times?
